      <div>
        <ul class="ingredients">
          <li>3 Eggs beaten</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
          <li>2 Mushrooms (optional)</li>
          <li>2 Ham slices chopped (optional)</li>
          <li>Chopped corriander (optional)</li>

        <ol class="directions">
          <li>Put three eggs in a bowl and beat with a fork.</li>
          <li>Turn on grill to full heat.</li>
          <li>Melt a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan. Once it begins to 'bubble' pour the beaten eggs into the pan.</li>
          <li>As the eggs begin to set on the bottom of the pan, gently move the set egg and allow the runny egg to take its place. Do not stir or you will get scrambled egg.</li>
          <li>While the egg is still a little runny on top add the optional ingredients if you want. Then place the frying pan under the grill until its browned on the top.</li>
          <li>Take it out the pan and serve on a plate.</li>

          <li>1 tablespoons of oil</li>
          <li>1 onion chopped</li>
          <li>2 cloves of garlic chopped</li>
          <li>250g of mice beef or lamb</li>
          <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of tomato purée</li>
          <li>4-5 mushrooms sliced</li>

          <li>Fill half a saucepan with water and wait for it to boil. Once the water is 'bubbling' lower the spaghetti into the water. Once the half that is in the water has softened push the other half in and simmer for 6-8 minutes.</li>
          <li>Drain the pasta and add a little olive oil to stop it sticking together. Serve on the plate with the Bolognese sauce on top. You can grate Parmesan or Cheddar cheese over the top if you like.</li>
