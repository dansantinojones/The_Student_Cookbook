      <p><strong>Have you ever opened the cupoard as a student to find the most random items of food and wonder... how
          can I make a meal from this? The Student Cookbook will give you basic, easy to make and affordable recipes and
          help you use those tins of beans that have been pushed to the back of your cupoard for months.</strong></p>
      <p> <br>
        The Student Cookbook is a team of ex-students, with culenery and nutrition degrees and pletny of experience creating affordable and quick meals. We have team
        members specialising in their own field to produce the best recipes for students to make between studying and
        partying.
        We understand everyone doesn’t have a passion for food and many may become a student without the essential
        skills. However, we are here to teach students the fundamentals of cooking. Some may develop a passion for
        cooking and we want their journey to start with us.
      </p> <br>
      <p>
        The recipes on this website are all trialled and tested by our professionals. The cooking and prep time is calculated over an average of three times to provide the most accurate experience for you. The average cost is calculated with from an average from Aldi to Sainsbury’s prices, however these may vary depending on your area you are studying in.
