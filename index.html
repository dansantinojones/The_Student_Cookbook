                    <p>The Student Cookbook is a team of ex-chefs, with experience creating affordable and quick meals. We have team members specialising in their own field to produce the best recipes for students to make between studying and partying.
              We understand everyone doesn’t have a passion for food and many may become a student without the essential skills. However, we are here to teach students the fundamentals of cooking. Some may develop a passion for cooking and we want their journey to start with us.
              Ever opened the cupoard as a student to find the most random items of food and wonder... how can I make a meal from this? The Student Cookbook will give you basic, easy to make and affordable recipes and help you use those tins of beans that have been pushed to the back of your cupoard for months.
